Usually, free software from Merethis comes in three different maners:

* binary RPM packages (recommanded)
* tarballs with sources
* Subversion git/repository

RPM packages are the best manner to get Merethis products. You don't
have to worry about compilation and installation, everything is
already made by Merethis' experts.

If you're platform is not currently supported by RPMs you might
consider using tarball sources which are always provided for stable
release. However compilation has to be done by hand which can be
sometimes tricky.

The last method is for developer or beta-testers only. No official
support is provided on such software as they usually are in-progress.
