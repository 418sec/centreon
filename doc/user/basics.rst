Basics

Here, you will see how to add your own resources, how to monitor them
and how to get notified when problems arise.

Check Commands
==============

Check commands are used for checking hardware and/or application
statuses of your Hosts/Services.

Command Creation
----------------

========================  ==============================================================================
 Field name                Description
========================  ==============================================================================
 Command Name              Name which will be used for identifying the command

 Command Type              Select the *Check* type

 Command Line              This will be executed by the scheduler, note that this line 
                           contains macros that will be replaced before execution. Always 
                           possible macros when possible. e.g: ``$USER1$/check_centreon_dummy``

 Argument example          This will provide argument example to the end users. The example 
                           apply to ``$ARGn$`` macros only and the expression is separated by the ``!``
                           character. In our case, *Hello world* will match ``$ARG1$`` and *0* will 
                           match ``$ARG2$``

========================  ==============================================================================

End users may not know the meaning of the arguments even though you
provided an example. You can hit the *Describe argument* button and
give a description to each of your ``$ARGn$`` macros.

Hit the *Save* button of the modal box to apply the descriptions, then
hit the *Save* button of the form to save your check command.

Notification Commands
=====================

Notification commands work pretty much like check commands but they
are used for notifying users and ``$ARGn$`` are not supported here.

.. image:: /_static/images/user/notif_check_1.png
   :align: center

Select the *Notification* type. The following command line will send
an email to the contact with the **mail** binary:

********
Contacts
********

Contacts are used for two main purposes:

* for logging in Centreon user interface
* for notifications

Now, let's see how to add a new user:

=====================================  ===============================================================

Hit the save button to add the new user.

*****
Hosts
*****

Hosts are basically devices that you monitor. Most of the time they
are just servers, routers, switches, firewalls, temperature probes
etc... Anything that own an IP address and that can communicate with
the Centreon server can be monitored.

.. image:: /_static/images/user/add_host_1.png

======================== =================================================================================
Host Name                Name used for identifying the host.

Host Templates           Templates are used for quick deployment. You can leave the parameters empty if 
                         you wish to use the ones that are set on the template. You can also set 
                         multiple templates.

Check Command            Check command that will be used for checking the status of the host. It is 
                         usually a ping check plugin that is behind a host check command.
Args                     ``$ARGn$`` arguments that will be used with the check command.                      

Max Check Attempts       Number of checks necessary to make sure that a Host is really DOWN (HARD state).

Normal Check Interval    The check frequency. e.g: Centreon-Server will be checked every 5 minutes.      

Retry Check Interval     The check frequency that will be used when a Host goes DOWN.

Notification Period      Period within which, notification will be sent out regarding the Host.          

Notification Options     Statuses for which notification will be sent out. e.g: notifications will be
                         sent out only if Centreon-Server goes DOWN.
======================== =================================================================================

********

Services are used for monitoring hardware and/or applications of a Host.

 Retry Check Interval    The check frequency that will be used when the Service goes to an non OK status.

 Notification Enabled    Whether or not notification is enabled for this Service.

 Linked Contacts         Contacts that will be notified when the Service is subject to a status change.

 Notification Period     Period within which, notification will be sent out regarding the Service.

 Notification Options    Statuses for which notification will be sent out. e.g: notifications will be sent out only if Centreon-Server goes WARNING or CRITICAL.
======================  ==================================================================================================================================================

Link this service to a Host:

.. image:: /_static/images/user/add_svc_3.png
   :align: center

Though it is possible to make one Service linked to multiple Hosts, we
strongly advise you not to do so. Refer to the "Best Practices" section.

Hit the *Save* button to add this service.

************
Time Periods
************

The installation of Centreon comes with default timeperiods which
should be sufficient for basic usage. Nonetheless, timeperiods are an
important component of our monitoring system. To put it simply, they
are used for notifications (notification periods) and checks (check
periods).

.. image:: /_static/images/user/add_tp_1.png
   :align: center

Here, you can specify the time range which is covered by the time
period, for each day:

.. image:: /_static/images/user/add_tp_2.png
   :align: center

===================  =====================================
Field name           Description 
===================  =====================================
Time Period Name     Name for identifying the timeperiod
Alias                Short description of the timeperiod
===================  =====================================

***
ACL
***

It is possible to configure ACL rules in order to restrict access to non admin users.

Access Groups
=============

Obviously, you will need to have contacts and/or contact groups defined before going any further. You can now start with the Access Group configuration:

.. image:: /_static/images/user/acl/acl_conf_1.png
   :align: center

======================  =====================================================
Field name              Description
======================  =====================================================
Group Name              Name for identifying the Access Group
Alias                   Short description of the Access Group
Linked Contacts	        Users who will be part of the Access Group
Linked Contact Groups   Contact Groups that will be part of the Access Group 
======================  =====================================================


Menu Access Rules
=================

Then, you can define the Menu access rules that will be applied to your Access Group:

.. image:: /_static/images/user/acl/acl_conf_2.png
   :align: center

======================  =====================================================
Field name              Description
======================  =====================================================
ACL Definition          Name for identifying the Access Rule
Alias                   Short description of the Access Rule
Status                  Whether or not the rule is enabled
Linked Groups           ACL rule will be applied to these Access Groups
======================  =====================================================

Grant access on the pages to the Access Groups:

.. image:: /_static/images/user/acl/acl_conf_3.png
   :align: center

It is possible to define *Read Only* restriction on some menus:

.. image:: /_static/images/user/acl/acl_conf_4.png
   :align: center


Action Access Rules
===================

Define the action privileges that will be granted to the Access groups.
