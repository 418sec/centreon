Time Periods
************

The installation of Centreon comes with default timeperiods which
should be sufficient for basic usage. Nonetheless, timeperiods are an
important component of our monitoring system. To put it simply, they
are used for notifications (notification periods) and checks (check
periods).

period, for each day:
