*       The **Home** menu enables access to the first home screen after logging in. It summarises the general status of the supervision.
*       The **Monitoring** menu contains the status of all the supervised elements in real and delayed time via the viewing of logs and performance graphics.
*       The **Reporting** menu serves to view, intuitively (via diagrams), the evolution of the supervision on a given period.
*	The **Configuration** menu serves to configure all monitored objects and the supervision infrastructure.
*       The **Administration** menu serves to configure the Centreon web interface and to view the general status of the servers.

 #.	Log in as a ‘root’ on the central server
 #.	Enter this command

::

    yum -y update

Allow the update to run fully and then restart the server in case of a kernel update.

Start your configuration by clicking `here<configuration_start>>`.
