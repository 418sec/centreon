Open Source software supplied by Centreon is generally available in 3 formats:

* RPM packages (recommended)
* archives containing the sources
* git repository

RPM packages are the best format to obtain our software. They are packaged by Centreon experts and relieve you of any concern over the installation process.

If your platform does not support RPM packages, you should use archives containing the sources of stable versions of our software and install them manually. Manual compilation of some packages can be complex.

The last format available is oriented for developers or beta-testers. No official help can be provided on these software versions considered to be in the process of development.

.. note::
 Centreon recommends using the Centreon Enterprise Server packaged version. Installation is detailed in the chapter entitled: :ref:`First steps with CES 3.0<firststepsces3>`
