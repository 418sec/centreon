Presentation
============

*Centreon Knowledge Base* aims to organize a technical knowledge base
of procedures to follow when a problem occurs on hosts/services. For
that, the module allows to link a host/service with a specific
procedure in Centreon. A procedure can also be linked to a template
for more flexibility.

So basically *Centreon Knowledge Base* is the one place to store
useful information on *"what to do if..."* a host/service
fails. Operators can effectively find quick answers and take quick
actions on the impacted resources.
